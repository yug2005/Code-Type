# Code Type

## About 

Code Type is a minimal and elegant application to allow users to get familiar and faster at typing code. It is currently in development and the website only supports pregenerated C++ code. 

The application will implement machine learning to generate code automatically and multiple languages will be supported for the user to choose from. 

The front-end uses React JS, TypeScript, CSS, and HTML. The routing and navigation is done through react-router-dom. 

The backend is currently a MySQL server for development however it will be transitioned to a MongoDB server. All get requests are through Node.js and Express JS.
